        <div class="page-content-body">
            <p>I'm really a beginner when it comes to tinkering with computers. However, my quality of life improved significantly once I started caring about my experience in front of a screen. I used to be <em>scared</em> of computers until my supervisor in university got me to make the jump to Linux. I suggest you try it out too!</p>
<h1 id="software">Software</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My Linux distribution is <a href="https://www.debian.org/"><em>Debian</em></a>. More control over your computer comes with a time cost, and one needs to strike a balance according to their needs. Debian sits in the middle of the spectrum between Windows and Arch Linux. I chose it because it's stable, meaning I get less crashes at the cost of slightly older software. Also, it was an easy transition from Ubuntu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I prefer <em>KDE</em> as a desktop environment. It's much more customisable than GNOME.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use the terminal with <em>bash</em> and <a href="https://tmux.github.io"><em>tmux</em></a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My text editor is <em>vim</em> (see below). In particular, <em>vim-gtk3</em>, which comes with system clipboard interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My browser is <em>Firefox</em>. It has the best support for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/"><em>uBlock Origin</em></a>, which ensures that you never get ads. I use <a href="https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox"><em>Betterfox</em></a> for privacy and <a href="https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl"><em>Tridactyl</em></a> for Vim keybindings. The add-on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-translate/"><em>Simple Translate</em></a> is convenient for pages in other languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're having difficulty falling asleep, reducing blue light in the evenings is a great help. I use KDE's canned solution called <em>Night Color</em>. Terminal enthusiasts can try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift_(software)"><em>redshift</em></a>, but I found it to be much more finicky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This website is powered by <a href="https://www.getzola.org/"><em>Zola</em></a>. It is less clunky than e.g. Hugo or Jekyll. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="phone">Phone</h1>
<p>All the apps I'll list are for <em>Android</em>, which is more customisable than iOS and has better file management and file transfer.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pipepipe.dev/"><em>PipePipe</em></a> – A front-end for YouTube which disables the ads, allows you to download videos, and can play music in the background. It's like <a href="https://newpipe.net/"><em>NewPipe</em></a>, but it's faster and I get fewer errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.ankidroid.org/"><em>AnkiDroid</em></a> – Does what it says on the tin (i.e. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/"><em>Anki</em></a> for Android). Converting Anki to a mobile game helps you to be more consistent with <a href="https://ncase.me/remember/">spaced repetition</a>. If you're learning a language or cramming for an exam, using Anki is mandatory. Unfortunately, the learning curve is dreadful, but this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmPx333n5UQ">tutorial</a> for the desktop version is good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officelens"><em>Microsoft Lens</em></a> – Perhaps surprisingly, other scanning apps still don't come close.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.nickfines.RealCalc&amp;hl=en_US"><em>RealCalc</em></a> – For your scientific calculator needs. I've been using it for about ten years now. Simple interface with big buttons means you can do calculations with astonishing speed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="vim">Vim</h1>
<p>Vim is a very powerful editor which is well worth learning. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type <em>vimtutor</em> in the terminal and follow the tutorial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just for a week or two, force yourself to use vim for all your text editing needs. If you need help, search online. This will feel very uncomfortable, but persevere!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By then you should be ready to work through the examples in <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition/">Practical Vim</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you're done with the book, you're safe to go out into the wild. You'll find additional tips on <a href="https://vimcasts.org">vimcasts.org</a> or <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/">/r/vim</a>. You might also enjoy playing <a href="https://www.vimgolf.com/">vimgolf</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Vim is extremely customisable, and this allows for some wizardry. For example, I've copied a workflow that makes working with LaTeX trivial via the plugin <a href="https://github.com/lervag/vimtex"><em>VimTeX</em></a> and the pdf viewer <a href="https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/"><em>Zathura</em></a>. See it in action on Elijan Mastnak's <a href="https://ejmastnak.com/tutorials/vim-latex/intro/">website</a>.</p>
<h1 id="other-tips">Other tips</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learn touch typing if you haven't yet. This will be very frustrating in the first month, but you will see substantial returns. Consider how many <a href="https://www.njbrown.com/blog/3/">hours</a> of your life you have lost because you couldn't transfer your thoughts to text quickly enough. Note that you shouldn't ask me for tips, as I sit at a measly <s>65</s> 75 words-per-minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With great power comes great responsibility. In Linux, you can break your whole system with a single command. If you want to mess with the plumbing, make sure you've backed up your computer first.</p>
