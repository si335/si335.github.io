One of the barriers to improving your life is not knowing at all that a given improvement exists. So, to follow in the footsteps of [many others](https://arjunpanickssery.substack.com/p/stuff-i-recommend-you-use), I'll outline what has worked for me. NB: Some of the links are relevant for my country only.

# Hardware

* Mouse – [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-eu/shop/p/mx-master-3s). The thumb rest thingy is uncomfortable in the beginning but soon you start to appreciate it. The scroller is also excellent. The rubber grip isn't that sturdy, you should carry a different mouse when travelling. (100$)

* Earbuds – [Redmi Buds 6 Pro](https://www.mi.com/global/product/redmi-buds-6-pro/). I started using earbuds in my twenty-fourth year on this Earth; it turns out they're really convenient. I'm quite happy with the sound quality, but they give me nasty headaches if used for more than an hour per day. (70$)

# Travel

* Backpack – [Canyon BPL-5](https://canyon.eu/product/cns-bpl5b1/). High quality, no visible wear after a year's use. Travel lightly, people always tend to overpack (30$).

* Mobile data – [Airalo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobillium.airalo&hl=en). The way this works is, you buy an eSIM for your destination country before travelling, and you can use the data only after you land. For some countries you can also get a local phone number (~10$ per trip).

* Earplugs – Essential for sleep in loud places (e.g. flights with babies). Foam is better than silicone or wax in my experience. 

* Sleep mask – Experiencing the sunrise as you're about to go to bed is patently soul-crushing, and this can save you in a pinch.

* Pill case – Put all the pills you need in a single container, rather than carrying several boxes of medicine that you'll never use.

# Health

* Melatonin (0.1-1 mg) – As elaborated [here](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/07/10/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/). Closest thing to a magic button for getting drowsy. Doesn't act immediately, you need to take it at least an hour before bed. Less is better, don't go for larger dosages. If you live in the UK or France, where it's prescription-only, you can get some over-the-counter while you're on holiday abroad ([~5$ for 2 months](https://adipharm.com/bg/product/melatonin-adifarm)).

* Camomile tea – A herbal alternative to sleeping pills which actually works. It has allowed me to reset my circadian rhythm when melatonin alone wouldn't cut it.

* Tretinoin – This is by far the most effective acne treatement, but it's also uncannily good for wrinkles. Prescription-only, but this isn't strictly enforced in Eastern Europe. Initially you will get skin flaking, like a lizard, so couple it with something for dry skin and use sunscreen. Reduce the dosage if it's too bad ([7$ per month](https://www.emag.bg/krem-menarini-a-ret-protiv-brychki-protiv-akne-anti-pete-tretinoin-0-025-tuba-20-gr-crst-unvs/pd/DHBB20MBM/)).

* Intermittent fasting – A diet where you don't restrict *what* you eat, only *when* you eat it. All your meals should fit within an 8-hour eating window (e.g. 12:00-20:00), or shorter. Of course it's not all roses, but when I'm following this, I lose the carb cravings and I get a greater appreciation for tasty food.

* Bright light – Keeping indoor lights on during the day helps with low mood in the winter. If this is not enough, look into [light therapy lamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy). People in Northern Europe love to supplement vitamin D. This prevents deficiency, but it doesn't make up for the lack of sunlight otherwise.

* Stannous fluoride toothpaste – Said to be more effective for cavity protection compared to normal fluoride. Wouldn't know anything about it, but it doesn't hurt to try ([3$ per month](https://lillydrogerie.bg/oral-b-proex-profprotect-pasta-za-z-bi-75ml-544556)).
