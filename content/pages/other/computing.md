I'm really a beginner when it comes to tinkering with computers. However, my quality of life has improved significantly since I started caring about my experience in front of a screen. I used to be *scared* of computers until my supervisor in university got me to make the jump to Linux. I suggest you try it out too!

# Setup

* I use *Ubuntu*. More control over your computer comes with a time cost, and one needs to strike a balance according to their needs. Ubuntu sits in the middle of the spectrum between Windows and Arch Linux. It works very well out of the box, and I don't have any major issues with it. I plan to switch to Arch in the future because it is more customisable.

* My text editor is *vim-gtk3*. I prefer it to plain Vim only because it can interact with the system clipboard. I use *VimTeX* when working with LaTeX files.

* My pdf viewer is *Zathura*. It's lightweight and has Vim keybindings.

* My browser is *Firefox*. I use *Betterfox* for privacy and *Tridactyl* for Vim keybindings.

* This website is powered by [*Zola*](https://www.getzola.org/). I chose it in favour of e.g. Hugo or Jekyll because it seemed less clunky. 

# Tips

* Learn touch typing if you haven't yet. This will be very frustrating in the first month, but you will see substantial returns. Consider how many hours of your life you have lost because you couldn't transfer your thoughts to text quickly enough.

* With great power comes great responsibility. In Linux, you can break your whole system with a single command. If you want to mess with the plumbing, make sure you've backed up your computer first.
