I'm really a beginner when it comes to tinkering with computers. However, my quality of life improved significantly once I started caring about my experience in front of a screen. I used to be *scared* of computers until my supervisor in university got me to make the jump to Linux. I suggest you try it out too!

# Setup

* My Linux distribution is *Debian*. More control over your computer comes with a time cost, and one needs to strike a balance according to their needs. Debian sits in the middle of the spectrum between Windows and Arch Linux. I chose it because it's stable, meaning there aren't any annoying and potentially dangerious updates. Also, it was an easy transition from Ubuntu.

* I prefer *KDE* as a desktop environment. It's much more customisable than GNOME.

* I use the terminal with *bash* and [*tmux*](https://tmux.github.io). 

* My text editor is *vim*. In particular, *vim-gtk3*, which comes with system clipboard interaction.

* My browser is *Firefox*. I use [*Betterfox*](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) for privacy and [*Tridactyl*](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) for Vim keybindings.

* This website is powered by [*Zola*](https://www.getzola.org/). I found it less clunky than e.g. Hugo or Jekyll. 

# Vim

Vim is a very powerful editor which is well worth learning. Here's how:

* Type *vimtutor* in the terminal and follow the tutorial.

* Just for a week or two, force yourself to use vim for all your text editing needs. If you need help, search online. This will feel very uncomfortable, but persevere!

* By then you should be ready to work through the examples in [Practical Vim](https://pragprog.com/titles/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition/).

* After you're done with the book, you're safe to go out into the wild. You'll find additional tips on [vimcasts.org](https://vimcasts.org) or [/r/vim](https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/). You might also enjoy playing [vimgolf](https://www.vimgolf.com/).

Vim is extremely customisable, and this allows for wizardry. For example, I've copied a workflow that makes working with LaTeX trivial via the plugin [*VimTeX*](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) and the pdf viewer [*Zathura*](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/). See it in action on Elijan Mastnak's [website](https://ejmastnak.com/tutorials/vim-latex/intro/).



# Tips

* Learn touch typing if you haven't yet. This will be very frustrating in the first month, but you will see substantial returns. Consider how many hours of your life you have lost because you couldn't transfer your thoughts to text quickly enough.

* With great power comes great responsibility. In Linux, you can break your whole system with a single command. If you want to mess with the plumbing, make sure you've backed up your computer first.
