I tend to watch rather than read, so you can find all sorts of content here. Maybe it's just me, but I don't remember much of what I've watched. Perhaps the [articles](/other/articles) I've saved are more insightful?

Many of the videos are put up as segues into channels that I enjoy; feel free to shop around. Conversely, the YouTube algorithm tends to lock you into a loop where you're shown videos from the same few channels, so I'd be grateful if you sent me anything else you found interesting.
