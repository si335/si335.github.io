I'm currently looking for a PhD. Previously I was a teacher at the Sofia High School of Mathematics. I hold a Master's degree from Cambridge, where I dabbled in gravity and statistical physics. You can find a CV [here](/cv_web.pdf).

Feel free to email me at [sivanov.mail@proton.me](mailto:sivanov.mail@proton.me).<br>
If you want to give me anonymous feedback on something, use this [form](https://forms.gle/4bNv8gYehaV3p8jF7).
