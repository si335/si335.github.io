# Olympiad advice

In the last few years many free resources on Olympiad physics have appeared on the internet. Good teachers and a good support network of similarly interested students still help a lot, but we're at a point where anyone can get top honours in an Olympiad if they go about it correctly. I think that the way to succeed is remarkably simple:  
* Find a good resource. (*textbooks* are preferable to lecture notes and Wikipedia)
* Really process it. (*engage brain* by writing it down, then *apply* the knowledge by solving problems)
* Repeat. (you'll have to *come back to it* until it is committed to long-term memory)

I recommend the following path:
* Read this [FAQ](https://knzhou.github.io/writing/Advice.pdf).
* Work through an introductory book such as Halliday, Resnick and Krane.
* Solve a few hundred problems from easier competitions. I write this with 9<sup>th</sup>/10<sup>th</sup> grade Russian Olympiads in mind, but F=ma and pre-2014 USAPhO work too.
* Go through Kevin Zhou's [handouts](https://knzhou.github.io/#teaching).
